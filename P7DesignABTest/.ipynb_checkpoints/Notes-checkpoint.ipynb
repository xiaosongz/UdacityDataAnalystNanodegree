    "* You will need a enough samples and the decision period(or response time) from your customers should be short enough! - this is why apartment finding website and car selling website are not a good place to luanch A/B testing, since people aren't buy car and rent new apartment so often.\n"

However, conversationally power often means the probability that your test draws the correct conclusions, and this probability depends on both alpha and beta. In this course, we'll use the second definition, and we'll use sensitivity to refer to $1 - \\beta$."
